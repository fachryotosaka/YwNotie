Suci Nur Insani, 

first and foremost, I want to express my deepest gratitude to you. Thank you for coming into my life, for bringing so much goodness and joy into it. Your presence has filled my days with happiness, and I am truly grateful to know you. I want you to know that I will always be here for you, no matter when or where. Whenever you need me, remember that I am here for you.

I promise to always do my best for you and to offer you as much good as I can. I want us to stay close and never grow distant or unfamiliar. I hope we can always be together, even though I don’t know what the future holds for us. But trust that I will always try my best for you and keep our communication strong.

You can always consider me your safe haven. When you’re sad, you can cry with me; when you’re angry, you can vent to me; when you’re happy, we can laugh together. If you ever feel burdened, share some of that load with me. I will always be here to help and support you. If you have a bad day, run to me, and remember that I am always here for you.

Thank you so much for everything you have given me. Your kindness and love mean the world to me. I appreciate every single thing you do, Yui. Thank you for being you, and for bringing many beautiful things into my life.
